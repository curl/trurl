.SH NAME
trurl \- transpose URLs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trurl [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B trurl
parses, manipulates and outputs URLs and parts of URLs.

It uses the RFC 3986 definition of URLs and it uses libcurl's URL parser to do
so, which includes a few "extensions".

Typically you set a few inputs and decide what of that you want output.
.SH "MISC OPTIONS"
.IP "-h, --help"
Show the help output.
.IP "-v, --version"
Show version information and exit.
.SH "INPUT OPTIONS"
.IP "--url [URL]"
Set the input URL to work with. The URL may be provided without a scheme,
which then typically is not actually a legal URL but trurl will try to figure
out what is meant and guess what scheme to use.

Providing multiple URLs will make trurl act on all URLs in a serial fashion.
.IP "--url-file [name]"
Read URLs to work on from the given file. Use the file name "-" (a single
minus) to tell trurl to read the URLs from stdin.

Each line needs to be a single valid URL and the line needs to end with a
newline. The maximum URL length supported in a file like this is 4095 bytes.
.IP "--redirect [URL]"
Redirect the base URL to this. It requires that you set the base url with \fB--url\fP
.IP "--append [component]=[data]"
Append data to a component. This can only append data to the path and the
query component.

For path:, this URL encodes and appends this segment to the path, separated
with a slash.

For query, this URL encodes and appends this segment to the query, separated
with an ampersand (&). If the segment contains an equal sign ('=') that will
be kept verbatim and both sides of the first occurrence will be URL encoded
separately.
.IP "--set [component][:]=[data]"
Set this URL component. Setting blank string ("") will clear it from the
URL.

The following components can be set: url, scheme, user, password,
options, host, port, path, query, fragment and zoneid.

If a simple "="-assignment is used, the data is URL encoded when applied. If
":=" is used, the data is assumed to already be URL encoded and will be stored
as-is.
.SH "OUTPUT OPTIONS"
.IP "--get [format]"
Output data according to the provided format string. Components from the URL
can be output when specified as \fB{component}\fP, with the name of the part
within curly braces. The following component names are available: {url},
{scheme}, {user}, {password}, {options}, {host}, {port}, {path}, {query},
{fragment} and {zoneid}.
.SH "MODIFIERS"
.IP "--urldecode"
By default each component is output using the format of the input (URL
encoded). This option makes trurl instead provide it URL decoded. Note that
%20 will then output space and %09 a tab etc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "Replace the host name of a URL"
.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se --set host=example.com
https://example.com/
.fi
.IP "Create a URL by setting components"
.nf
 $ trurl --set host=example.com --set scheme=ftp
 ftp://example.com/
.fi
.IP "Redirect a URL"
.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se/we/are.html --redirect here.html
https://curl.se/we/here.html
.fi
.IP "Change port number"
This also shows how trurl will remove dot-dot sequences

.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se/we/../are.html --set port=8080
https://curl.se:8080/are.html
.IP "Extract the path from a URL"
.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se/we/are.html --get '{path}'
/we/are.html
.IP "Extract the port from a URL"
This gets the default port based on the scheme if the port is not set in the
URL.

.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se/we/are.html --get '{port}'
443
.IP "Append a path segment to a URL"
.nf
$ trurl --url https://curl.se/hello --append path=you
https://curl.se/hello/you
.IP "Append a query segment to a URL"
.nf
$ trurl --url "https://curl.se?name=hello" --append query=search=string
 https://curl.se/?name=hello&search=string
.IP "Read URLs from stdin"
.nf
$ cat urllist.txt | trurl --url-file -
